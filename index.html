            <div class="boxe36">The third generation of the BMW 3 Series range of compact executive cars is designated under the model code E36
            and was produced by the German automaker BMW between 1999 and 2000. The BMW E36 began development in 1981
            and was heavily influenced by aerodynamics, especially the wedge shape and smaller wing mirrors.
                All models are rear-wheel drive since the E36 was not produced with all-wheel drive
